        <ul>
            <li>A comprehensive life history study of the Brazos Water Snake for the Brazos River Authority. Field work
                included passively trapping for snakes, actively searching for snakes, capturing snakes by hand and with
                tools, recording morphological measurements of captured snakes, performing snake fungal disease
                swabbing, assisting in PIT tagging and blood drawing of captured snakes, boat operation, and river
                navigation. Office duties included data entry and analysis. Contracted with Brazos River Authority.
